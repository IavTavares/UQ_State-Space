# UQ_State-Space
Quantification of model discrepancy, aka epistemic uncertainty in the ML community, in state-space models using Gaussian processes.


Context: 
In any scientific context  researchers, in their pursuit of how reality works, have to make some modelling assumptions, by assuming a certain function for the process generating the data. This usually means that the researcher is assuming that the data is drawn from a certain distribution.  However, these assumptions may be severely inadequate, depending on the context. Hence the need to quantify this inadequacy, which may also be called model discrepancy.

In Macroeconomics, there's a real need for this type of quantification, ever since the financial crisis the 2007-2008 showed some of the limitations of its theoretical models, usually stated in a state-space form.


Problem Statement:
 How to quantify the inadequacy of a state-space model in the Macroeconomic context?

Answer:
We'll try to model that model discrepancy using a Gaussian Process.
